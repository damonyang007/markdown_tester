## Abstract

A novel hyaluronic acid (HA)-modified hybrid nanocomplex HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93CpPAMAM, which could efficiently deliver siRNA into tumor cells via a redox-mediated intracellular disassembly, was constructed for enhanced antitumor efficacy. Thereinto, siR-93C (siRNA) and positive PAMAM were firstly mixed into the electrostatic nano-intermediate, and then diselenide bond (SeSe)-modified HA was covered to shield excessive positive charges. This hybrid nanocomplex displayed uniform dynamic sizes, high stability, controlled zeta potential and narrow PDI distribution. Moreover, the -SeSe- linkage displayed GSH/ROS dual responsive properties, improving intracellular trafficking of siRNA. In vitro assays in A549 cell line presented that HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93CpPAMAM has low cytotoxicity, rapid lysosomal escape and significant transfection efficiency; besides, an efficient proliferation inhibition ability and enhanced apoptosis. Furthermore, in animal studies, this negative-surfaced hybrid nanocomplex showed a prolonged circulation in blood and improved inhibition of tumor growth. All these results verified our hypothesis in this study that diselenide bonds-modified HA could promote not only stability and safety of nanoparticles in vivo but also intracellular behavior of siRNA via redox-dual sensitive properties; furthermore, this hybrid nanocomplex provided a visible potential approach for siRNA delivery in antitumor therapy.

## Introduction
Recently, RNA interference (RNAi) technology has become a promising strategy for the treatment of major diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, etc. (Napoli et al., 1990; Guo et al., 2010; Kapoor et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2016). However, due to the existence of abundant RNase and the stability problem of RNA, including degradation during transport and transfection, RNAi-based agents are easily inactivated during systemic circulation; on the other side, the safe and effective delivery of RNAi agents, such as siRNA to target cells and efficient release into cytoplasm, still remains major hurdle for the clinical application of therapeutic RNAs, including siRNAs (Verma & Somia, 1997). Therefore, it is critical to design and

escape of loaded agents via ‘proton sponge’ effect, which could protect genes from lysosomal degradation and further enhance transfection efficiency (Shen et al., 2010). However, due to the high positive charge on the surface, the toxicity profile of PAMAM is still a major problem limiting its preclinical research and clinical applications (Lee et al., 2009; Mukherjee et al., 2010). In order to reduce the toxicity of PAMAM, surface modification and/or cation block strategies are very much required (Waite et al., 2009; Jin et al., 2011; Chang et al., 2017; Li et al., 2021). However, as the membrane potential of cells is usually negative, the decrease of the surface positive charge of vectors would lead to reduced cellular uptake and gene transfection efficiency (Jiang et al., 2009).

Stimuli-triggered dis- shielding strategies have attracted enormous interest and boosted intense studies to improve the safety of PAMAM, and redox-triggered dis-shielding is one of them, which is highly valued in cancer treatment. Compared with normal cells, most tumor cells exhibit higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and glutathione (GSH), it has been reported that the concentration of GSH in cancer cells (2 – 10 mM) was much higher than that in normal cells (2 – 20 μM) (Fang et al., 2009; Du et al., 2020; Li et al., 2021). This unique redox environment of tumor allows the breakage of redox sensitive bonds, for example, disulfide bonds or diselenide bonds, to release loaded cargoes (Shen et al., 2010; Yin et al., 2016; Li et al., 2021). More recently, diselenide bonds have emerged as attractive bio-signaling linkage. Similar as disulfide bonds, diselenide bonds could be cleaved at a tumor-relevant redox environment (Ma et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2017). In addition, block copolymers containing diselenide bonds also have γ-ray response capabilities, indicating that the diselenide bonds can be used to combine chemotherapy and radiotherapy (Cao et al., 2013), and it is also reported that selenium compounds can help treatment of COVID-19 (Kieliszek & Lipinski, 2021).

Because of the safety problem of PAMAM associated with positive charges on the surface, we designed and syntheszied a redox-sensitive anionic block copolymer to solve the biosefaty limitation of PAMAM dendrimer. In the present study, PAMAM dendrimer was used to load siRNA (siR-93C@PAMAM), and the diselenide bonds-modified hyaluronic acid (HA) derivative was constructed (HA-SeSe-COOH) to conjugate with cationic siR-93C@PAMAM via electrostatic interaction (HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM) for the positive charge shielding, in order to achieve effective intracellular siRNA ddelivery (shown in Scheme 1). In vitro efficacy of the hybrid complex was investigated by monitoring particle size, stability, cytotoxicity, uptake mechanism, lysosomal escape ability, transfection efficiency and cell cycle arrest on A549 (KRAS mutation) human lung carcinoma cells. Furthermore, in vivo performances, such as in vivo distribution, tumor progression inhibition and biocompatibility, were also evaluated on A549 tumor-bearing mice.

## 2.3. Assembly of HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM complexes

siRNA (siR-93C) was diluted in RNase/DNase-free sterile microcentrifuge tubes to provide a final concentration of 0.05 mg/mL. The complexation of siR-93C with G4 PAMAM was undertaken at the N/P ratio of 0.5,1,2,4,6,8,10 in 10 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.4 as previously reported (Jensen et al., 2010; Pavan et al., 2010; Jensen et al., 2011). Briefly, a total volume of 500 µL siR-93C solutions was gently added to the PAMAM solution, followed by 20 s of vortex mixing and further incubated at room temperature for 20 min to form siR-93C@PAMAM. HA-SeSe-COOH then was gently added into the pre-prepared siR-93C@PAMAM to construct HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM complexes by electrostatic self-assembly. For example, specific weight of HA-Se-Se-COOH was added to siR-93C@PAMAM solution, vortexed for 30 seconds, and incubated for 20 more minutes at room temperature to complete HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM complex formation. HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM complexes with various ratios of HA-SeSe-COOH to siR-93C@PAMAM (w/w) from 0.2 to 4 were achieved in this study.

### 2.4.1. Size and zeta potential measurements

The particle size and zeta potential of siR-93C@PAMAM and HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM were measured by Malvern Instruments (Zetasizer Nano ZS, Malvern, UK). Complexes aggregation was determined by the polydispersity index (PDI) value. The morphology of HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-1400 Plus, Tokyo, Japan).

### 2.4.2. Gel electrophoresis assay

The siRNA compaction capability of PAMAM was evaluated by agarose gel retardation assay. siR-93C@PAMAM complexes were prepared with the final siRNA concentration of 0.05 mg/mL. Different N/P complexes solutions (10 µL) were analyzed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis (100 V, 30 min) (Ziraksaz et al., 2013). Then, the gel was stained with Fluorescent DNA loading buffer, and the stained bands were visualized under ultraviolet (UV) illumination light.

### 2.4.3. Redox sensitivity of HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM

HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM were treated with L-Glutathione (GSH concentration 20 µM to 10 mM) (Huang et al., 2018; Du et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2020; Li et al., 2021), H₂O₂ (7.0 µmol/L or 1.0 mmol/L) (Mueller, 2000; Boveris et al., 2002; Martin & Barrett, 2002; Stone & Yang, 2006; Giorgio et al., 2007), and normal saline, respectively. The particle size and the polydispersity index of five groups were measured every 30 min to evaluate the redox sensitivity of HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM.

In this study, cell viability was determined by MTT assay (Bansal et al., 2014). A549 cell line was cultured in DMEM medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37°C with 5% CO₂ in a humidified incubator. In the cell viability assay, A549 cells were seeded at 0.35

# 4_0.png
transfection reagent Lipofectamine-2000 (Lipo2000) was used as the parallel control group.

## 2.5.4. In vitro siRNA transfection assay
A549-Luc cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 0.3 × 10⁴ cells per well in 200 µL complete culture medium. After 24 h, culture medium was removed, and the cells were cleaned with PBS twice. Then, 100 µL of fresh complexes was added to each well (final siRNA concentration was 100 nM). 4 h later, the transfection medium was replaced with fresh complete DMEM medium. After 48 h incubation, cells were washed with PBS twice and lysed with luciferase cell culture lysis buffer (He et al., 2015). After 10 min incubation without light later, the luciferase activity was decided by microplate reader (Model 550, Bio-Rad, USA).

## 2.5.5. Wound healing assay
A549 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 2 × 10⁵ cells/well and cultured 24 h to reach 90% confluence as a monolayer. Then the monolayer was scratched with a sterile pipette tip (200 µL type) and washed with PBS twice (Wang et al., 2015; Li et al., 2020). The cells were treated by the complexes and continued to culture in DMEM containing 10% FBS for 72 h and the untreated group was used as Control group, the wound areas were measured by micro- plate reader (Model 550, Bio-Rad, U.S.A) at 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 and 72 h, respectively.

## 2.5.6. Transwell migration assay
The cell culture and transfection process were performed as described previously. After trypsinization, A549 cells were plated in the upper chamber inserted in 24-well plates with serum-free DMEM at a density of 2.0 × 10⁴ cells/well, and DMEM with 10% FBS was added into the lower chamber. After incubation for 24 h, cells in the upper chamber were wiped by cotton swab, and cells migrated to the lower surface were fixed with ethanol at 4℃ for 15 min and stained with 0.2% crystal violet for 30 min (Wang et al., 2015; Li et al., 2020). The stained cells were then rinsed with PBS and recorded by Olympus fluorescence microscope. The stained cells were dissolved in 33% (v/v) acetic acid solution and measured on microplate reader at 578 nm, and untreated group was used as the Control group.

## 2.5.7. Cell cycle analysis
A549 cells (2 × 10⁵ cells/well) were exposed to various complexes solution (final concentration of siR-93C was 100 nM) for 24 h. Then, the harvested cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 70% ethanol at −20℃ for 1 hour. The fixed cells were centrifuged and washed with PBS three times. One unit of RNase was added to cell suspension and incubated for 30 min at 37℃, then the cells were stained with PI solution (200 µL) for 30 min in the dark. Subsequently, a flow cytometer was used to analyze the cell cycle distribution.

different complexes which was diluted in serum-free DMEM was added to each well for 6 h incubation. After trypsinization, the medium was removed, and cells were washed with PBS twice. Then, cells were resuspended in binding buffer and stained by FITC/PI staining solution at room temperature for 15 minutes without light. The cells were analyzed by flow cytometry within 1 hour to detect cell apoptosis ratio.

## 2.5.9. Western blotting

## 2.7. Statistical analysis

Data were presented as mean ± standard deviations (SD). Statistical comparisons between two groups were evaluated using unpaired Student’s t-test (two tailed) and performed by GraphPad Prism 8.0. A value of $p < 0.05$ was considered statistically significant.

## 3. Results and discussion

### 3.1. Synthesis of HA-SeSe-COOH

HA-SeSe-COOH was synthesized following the route in Figure 1(A), and the chemical structure of the product was determined by $^1H$-NMR and FT-IR spectroscopy. Figure 1(B) shows $^1H$-NMR spectrum of HA-SeSe-COOH. From $^1H$-NMR spectrum, characteristic peaks from 3.16 – 3.75 ppm were attributed to the hydrogen (H-1,2,3,4,7,8,9,10) from D-glucuronic acid unit of HA, resonance at 4.39 ppm and 4.31 ppm were from H-6 and H-5 of the hyaluronic acid. Signal at 3.08 ppm was assigned to H-1' and H-6' which were connected to secondary amine, methyl group (H-12) could be seen at 2.01 ppm. In addition, resonance at 1.07 ppm corresponded to the protons of H-2' and H-5' which were attached to -SeSe-. $^1H$-NMR result confirmed the successful synthesis of HA-SeSe-COOH. In the FT-IR spectra of HA and HA-SeSe-COOH (Figure 1(C)), the broadband in the region of 3000 – 3700 cm$^{-1}$ was attributed to the stretching vibration of the hydroxyl groups of HA, peaks at 2859 cm$^{-1}$ and 2916 cm$^{-1}$ were from the stretch vibration of -CH$_2$- groups from Selenocystamine. The characteristic absorption peak of -Se-Se- at 710 cm$^{-1}$ and stretch vibration of -CH$_2$-Se- at 614 cm$^{-1}$ indicated the successful construction of HA-SeSe-COOH.

### 3.2. Characterization of HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93@PAMAM hybrid nanocomplex

To design a complex vector taking advantage of PAMAM, siR-93@PAMAM complexes were constructed at various nitrogen to phosphorus ratios (N/P, the mole ratio of the amine groups of PAMAM to the phosphate groups of siRNAs) to determine the optimum amount of siRNA and PAMAM. The optimized N/P was determined by agarose gel electrophoresis (in Figure 2(A)). The results show that when the N/P ratio was greater than 10, no free siRNA signal could be detected by agarose gel.

Under this N/P ration, the particle size of constructed siR-93C@PAMAM complex was 149 nm (PDI = 0.114), and the zeta potential of complex was +24.7 mV (shown in Figure 2(B)). Further, in order to reduce the surface positive charge to improve the stability of siRNA during blood circulation, HA-SeSe-COOH was introduced as the outer shell to cover the inner core siR-93C@PAMAM; at the same time, the particle size of HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM would be increased also. To optimize the employed amount of HA-SeSe-COOH, different mass ratios of HA-SeSe-COOH to siR-93C@PAMAM were tested between 0.2/1 and 4/1. The particle size results are shown in Table 1. It was found that when the ratio was from 0.6/1 to 1.2/1, there was no nano association complex constructed in the system, this may be caused by the random aggregation of siR-93C@PAMAM and HA-SeSe-COOH when the zeta potential of mixture close to zero. On the other side, the amount of HA-SeSe-COOH could not only affect the stability of complex, but also affect the surface charge and particle size of HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM. It was found that when the HA-SeSe-COOH was less than siR-93C@PAMAM, the zeta potential of complex was positively charged even the particle size could be similar to each other. For example, when the mass ratio of HA-SeSe-COOH to siR-93C@PAMAM was 0.3/1 and 3/1, complexes with similar particle size (197 nm and 181 nm, respectively) would be obtained, however, the zeta potential was markedly different, positive complex (+12.4 mV) was constructed when the ratio was 0.3/1 compared with negatively charged complex (-24.6 mV) with the ratio of 3/1. Considering the issue of biological safety (which will be discussed in the next section), the ratio of 3/1 was used in the following study which the siRNA-loading efficiency was 3.23%. The morphology of HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM (with the ratio of 3/1) was observed by TEM to further obtain the nanostructure information. TEM image (Figure 2(C)) showed that HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM was spherical particle with the obvious nano structure.

#### 3.3. Redox sensitivity of HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM
Intracellular disassemble behavior of this hybrid nanocomplex is considered as a key step for siRNA delivery. Redox-responsive cleavage could have the function enhancing siRNA release into cytoplasm, upgrading final transfection. Figure 2(D)) shows the redox sensitivity of HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-

ment with free HA, showing that HA-CD44 binding would improve the internalization of HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM nanocomplex.

3.6. Lysosomal escape

It is well known that the internalized RNA and/or drugs are easily degraded by lysosome enzymes, such as acid RNases and endonucleases, resulting in reduced anti-cancer efficacy (Huang et al., 2020). Thus, lysosomal escape ability of siRNA loaded complex is crucial for enhancing the therapeutic efficacy. The lysosomal escape ability study was investigated using confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM). From the CLSM images (shown in Figure 3(C)), the yellow signal, overlap area of red fluorescence (lysosome) and green fluorescence (green fluorescent FAM labeled siR-93C), indicated that siR-93C was trapped in lysosome; after siR-93C escaped from lysosome, bright cyan fluorescence could be observed from CLSM image, also the separation of green fluorescence with red region was detected (shown in Figure S1). In siR-93C@Lipo2000 group, siR-93C was mainly present in the lysosome at 2 h. Although there was slight cyan fluorescence signal could be observed at 4 h, the stronger yellow signal indicated that most of the siRNA was still localized in lysosome until 8 h. In the siR-93C@PAMAM and HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM groups, a fast and effective lysosomal escape could be observed at even 2 h as the cyan signal was clearly observed from CLSM indicating the spread out of the siR-93C from lysosome. The effective lysosomal escape ability was accounted by the proton sponge effect of PAMAM. Though the HA-SeSe-COOH shell may affect the efficiency of lysosome escape, the GSH-responsive disassembly of the shell and re-exposure of siR-93C@PAMAM in the tumor intracellular environment could still trigger the lysosome escape.

3.7. Transfection behavior of HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM

Luciferase activity assay was performed to investigate the transfection efficiency of HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM. As shown in Figure 4(A), the results showed that the transfection efficiency was improved when increasing the siRNA concentration, all the group showed the highest transfection efficiency when the siR-93C concentration was improved to 100 nM, which was almost 2-fold as compared to 10 nM. Surprisingly, luciferase expression in siR-93C@PAMAM, HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM (0.3/1) and HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM (3/1) was no significant difference. It has been found that the positively charged particles strongly interact with cells and penetrate into the cells more effectively than negatively charged particles. In this study, siR-93C@PAMAM and HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM (0.3/1) were positively charged, whereas the HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM (3/1) was obviously negatively charged. The possible explanation for transfection result was that the penetration ability of HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM (3/1) into A549 cells could be improved by the hyaluronic acid – derivative shell, as hyaluronic acid could specifically bind to CD44 which was overexpressed on A549 cells surface (Cano et al., 2020).

3.8. Cell migration and invasion in vitro

Compared to other tumor cells, strong invasiveness and high migration ability were observed in A549 cells. Thus, the

migration and invasion of A549 cells by HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93G@PAMAM were evaluated.

### 3.8.1. Wound healing assay
In order to study the migration ability of A549 cells transfected by siR-93C/Lipo2000, wound scratches were observed and measured every 12h after transfection. As shown in Figure 4(B,C), the cells in Control group displayed the strongest migration ability, and the siNC@Lipo2000 also exhibited obvious healing trend, whereas the siNC@PAMAM, siR-93C@PAMAM and HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM groups showed obvious inhibitory effects of migration. At 72 h, the wound scratch ratio of the control group was 56.7%, whereas the wound scratch ratios of the siR-93C@PAMAM and HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM groups were still 84.7% and 92.6%, respectively. The relative larger wound size in HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM group indicated the stronger ability of inhibiting A549 cells migration, which was due to the successful delivery and effective expression of siRNA in the cells.

### 3.8.2. Transwell assay
Transwell migration assay also was performed to further investigate the anti-invasive effects in A549 cells after the siR-93C transfection (Figure 4(D,E)). It can be seen that the cells still exhibited strong invasive ability in the Control group, siNC group and HA-SeSe-COOH/siNC@PAMAM group. Nevertheless, the number of cells passing through the chamber in the siNC@PAMAM, siR-93C@PAMAM and HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM groups were dramatically decreased, with ratios were only 74.5%, 57.2%, and 35.2%, respectively. It should be noted that the number of penetrated cells in the siNC@PAMAM group was relatively lower than other groups, which was related to the cytotoxicity of PAMAM itself. The Transwell cell invasion results showed that siRNA transfection via HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM delivery could decrease the invasion ability of A549 cells.

### 3.9. Cycle arrest and apoptosis
The results of the above experiments confirmed that HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM did exhibit antitumor ability. Here, the inhibit effect in proliferation of A549 cells was further assessed, and flow cytometry was used to evaluate the cycle arrest and cell apoptosis of A549 cells (shown in Figure 5(A-D)). In the tumor cell cycle arrest analysis (Figure 5(A,B)), compared with the control group (the proportion of G1-phase cells was 48.98%), the proportion of G1-phase cells in the HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM group was 72.2%, which proved that HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM could induce G1-phase cell cycle arrest in A549 cells. Meanwhile, the proportions of S-phase cells in siR-93C@Lipo2000, siR-93C@PAMAM, and HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM groups were 26.8%, 24.7%, and 20.4%, respectively.

In the cell apoptosis analysis results (Figure 5(C,D)), compared to the control group (1.13%), obvious early apoptosis could be achieved in HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93C@PAMAM group

both siR-93@PAMAM and HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93@PAMAM exhibited more powerful ability of inducing cell apoptosis (11.03% and 27.7%) than siR-93@Clip2000 (6.40%). Surprisingly, HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93@PAMAM exhibited stronger ability of inducing early cell apoptosis than siR-93@PAMAM (2.70%). These results further confirmed that the HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93@PAMAM exhibited better siRNA transfection ability and can be applied for siRNA anti-tumor therapy.

93@PAMAM mainly passively accumulated in the tumor and distributed in the lung and kidney. On the other side, due to the positively charged property, siR-93@PAMAM could be easily captured and rapidly eliminated by reticuloendothelial systems (RES) and exhibited short circulation time after intravenous administration. As expected, tumor signal in HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93@PAMAM group was initially observed and accumulated at 3 h up to 12 h (fluorescence intensity was still extremely high after 12 h), which was due to the active targeting and binding ability of HA to CD44 (overexpressed on A549 cells). At the same time, the protective outer layer of HA-SeSe-COOH could allow complex a longer circulation time, consequently, increasing the accumulation within tumors (Ho et al., 2019).

Scheme 1. Schematic illustration of the mechanism of redox-sensitive hybrid nanocomplex loading with siRNA (HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93@PAMAM). HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93@PAMAM is constructed by siR-93@PAMAM and HA-SeSe-COOH via electrostatic assembly process. In the redox TME, diselenide bonds-modified HA begins to break down and disassemble to re-expose the PAMAM, which could promote the lysosomal escape of loaded siRNA and to further enhance transfection efficiency.

![12_1.png](12_1.png)

In vivo distribution results have shown that siR-93@PAMAM has strong lung accumulation and also certainly level of kidney accumulation. Taken together, it is not surprising that siR-93@PAMAM would induce lung and kidney damage. As a contrast, insignificant inflammation and negligible necrotic cells could be observed in HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93@PAMAM treated group, indicating that the outer layer HA-SeSe-COOH did significantly improve the biosafety of PAMAM.

In summary, a redox-responsive siRNA targeted delivery vector, HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93@PAMAM, was constructed and employed as vector for KRAS siRNA transfection. Due to the superb internalization via clathrin-dependent pathway and excellent endosomal escape capability, HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93@PAMAM exhibited favorable transfection efficiency. Importantly, HA-SeSe-COOH/siR-93@PAMAM could induce the cell apoptosis and the cell cycle arrest at G1 phase.
